# Unit-6-Challenge
## Homework challenge for Unit 6: Server-Side APIs

## Having read the instructions, I have, to the best of my abilities, done the following:

- created a weather dashboard that takes in a city as a search and displays the current weather information
- nearly got it finished in terms of the 5 day forecast elements as well but need to move on to the next project
- added screenshots and links to this readme for the deployed application repo
- pushed my files to GitHub and deployed them to a live site through GitHub
- submitted the deployed application URL and GitHub repo to BCS for review and grading
